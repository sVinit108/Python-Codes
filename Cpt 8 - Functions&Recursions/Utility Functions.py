'''
A utility function in Python is a small, self-contained piece of code that performs a specific task. It's called a "utility" because it's a helpful tool that makes a certain task easier to perform. These functions are not meant to be standalone, but rather to be used in conjunction with other code. They are reusable and can be used in multiple places within a project, making code easier to maintain.
Some common examples of utility functions in Python include string manipulation functions like strip(), replace(), and split(), as well as mathematical functions like sum() and max().
