'''
Decorator, as can be noticed by the name, is like a designer that helps to modify a function. 
The decorator can be said to be a modification to the external layer of function, as it does not change its structure. 
A decorator takes a function and inserts some new functionality in it without changing the function itself
There are two ways to write a Python decorator:
We can pass our function to the decorator as an argument, thus defining a function and passing it to our decorator.
 We can simply use the @ symbol before the function weâ€™d like to decorate.
